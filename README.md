Yet another way to install [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/) via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

# Installation

```$ composer create-project rougin/ignite 'codeigniter'```

# Why?

Just for fun! :smile: I'm finding another way to install CodeIgniter via Composer. I know there [are](https://github.com/compwright/codeigniter-installers) [some](https://github.com/rogeriopradoj/codeigniter-composer) [many](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) [ways](https://github.com/kenjis/codeigniter-composer-installer) on how to do it but I just need to fill my craving for it.
